                        time before he/she accepts an Offer. Cititasker reserves

                        1.4 If a Poster accepts an Offer on the Cititasker
                        Platform, a Task Contract is created between the Tasker
                        and the Poster.

                        rendered Cititasker Services and the Service Fee is due
                        and payable.

                        1.7 Once the Task Contract is created, the Tasker and
                        Poster may vary the Task Contract on the Cititasker
                        Platform. The Poster and Tasker are encouraged to use
                        Cititasker's private messaging system to amend or vary
                        the Task Contract (including the Agreed Price) or to
                        otherwise communicate.

                        Recurring Services a Task Contract is created for the
                        first Occurrence only). For Recurring Services, the next
                        Task Contract is created upon completion of the previous
                        Occurrence.

                        1.15 A Poster may revoke or modify its Offer in using
                        Search Assist, including for Recurring Services, at any
                        time before a Tasker makes an Instant Claim. Cititasker
                        reserves the right to cancel all Posted Tasks made prior
                        to the revocation or modification.

                        confirms the Occurrence is completed (or if Cititasker
                        is satisfied the Occurrence is completed) then the
                        Tasker Funds for that Occurrence will automatically be
                        released by Cititasker from the Payment Account to the
                        Tasker.

                        Tasker Funds for an Occurrence within 24 hours from when
                        the Tasker confirms the Occurrence is completed. If the
                        Poster pauses such automatic payment in accordance with
                        this clause, then the Tasker Funds will not be released
                        by Cititasker from the Payment Account to the Tasker
                        until the Poster also confirms that the Occurrence is
                        completed.

                        the jurisdiction where the Services are performed. You

                        Services), the Tasker is solely responsible for
                        obtaining any reimbursement from the Poster. Cititasker
                        advises Taskers not to agree to incur costs in advance
                        of receiving the payment for these costs, unless the

                        to a third party in accordance with a Task Contract,

                        by Cititasker (if any) responds to that claim then this
                        clause applies. If a claim is made against a Tasker,

                        to make a claim under any applicable policy and if the

                        recover any excess or deductible payable in respect of
                        the claim from the Tasker. Where Cititasker makes a
                        claim and the insurer assesses that the Tasker is
                        responsible, Cititasker is entitled to rely on that
                        assessment. If You do not pay any excess due under this

                        some or all of the excess paid by it against future
                        moneys it may owe to You.

                        by Cititasker (if any) does not respond to the claim or
                        the claim is below the excess payable to the insurer,
                        then this clause applies. Cititasker may elect to reject
                        or pay an amount to settle a claim not covered by
                        Cititasker's own insurance policies. To the extent that
                        the Tasker was or would be liable for the amount of the
                        claim, if Cititasker elects to pay an amount to settle
                        the claim the amount paid by Cititasker may be recovered
                        by Cititasker from the Tasker. Cititasker may also elect
                        to set this amount off against future moneys it may owe

                  <h2>MODEL TASK CONTRACT</h2>
                  <p>
                    The terms used in this Task Contract have the meaning set
                    out in the Cititasker Glossary. A Task Contract is created
                    in accordance with the Cititasker Agreement. Unless
                    otherwise agreed, the Poster and the Tasker enter into a
                    Task Contract on the following terms:
                  </p>
                  <ul>

                            1.1 The Task Contract is created when the Poster
                            accepts the Tasker's Offer on a Posted Task to
                            provide Services. When using Search Assist, the Task
                            Contract is created when the Tasker makes an Instant
                            Claim.

                            to any third party without the Poster's consent.

                        goods or service supplied), arising out of or in any way
                        connected with any transaction between You and any Third
                        Party Service provider who may be included from time to

                        You suffer that is a foreseeable result of Cititasker's
                        breach of this Agreement or Cititasker's negligence, but
                        Cititasker is not responsible for any loss or damage
                        that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable
                        if it was an obvious consequence of Cititasker's breach
                        or if it was contemplated by You and Cititasker at the
                        time that this Agreement became binding.

                        shall not be liable to You for any loss or damage

                        liability to any User under this Agreement is limited to
                        the total amount of payment made by that User to
                        Cititasker during the twelve month period prior to any
                        incident causing liability of Cititasker, or £30.00,

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        (1) This Agreement is governed by English law. This
                        means that Your access to and use of the Cititasker
                        Platform, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in
                        connection therewith (including non-contractual disputes
                        or claims) will be governed by English law.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                        Agreement in the English courts. However, as a consumer,
                        if You live in another European Union member state You
                        can bring legal proceedings in respect of this Agreement
                        in either the English courts or the courts of that
                        Member State.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                      <p>
                        (3) As a consumer, if You are resident in the European
                        Union and Cititasker directs the Cititasker Platform to
                        the member state in which You are resident, You will
                        benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the
                        country in which You are resident. Nothing in this
                        Agreement, including paragraph (1) above, affects Your
                        rights as a consumer to rely on such mandatory
                        provisions of local law.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                      <p>
                        (4) If we are not able to satisfy Your complaint about
                        our Services, then Your complaint can be addressed to
                        the Online Dispute Resolution website at
                        http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/ an official website
                        managed by the European Commission dedicated to helping
                        consumers and traders resolve their disputes
                        out-of-court.

                  </ul>
                  <p>f) The following tax provisions shall apply:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        (1) If You are a Tasker, You must have the right to
                        provide Services under a Task Contract and to work in
                        the United Kingdom and You must not be established for
                        VAT purposes outside the United Kingdom. You must comply
                        with tax and regulatory obligations in relation to any
                        payment (including the Tasker Funds) received under a
                        Task Contract. You must not sell goods as a separate
                        supply through the Cititasker Platform. If there is an
                        incidental supply of goods as part of a supply of
                        Services, then paragraph (2) will apply.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        (2) If the supply of any goods is part of a single
                        supply of services for VAT purposes (and is not a
                        separate supply), then the consideration for such goods
                        will be part of the Agreed Price. If You are a Tasker
                        and you supply any goods in conjunction with Your
                        Services and such goods would constitute a separate
                        supply for VAT purposes, then:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>

                        the Member State in which You are resident, You will
                        benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the

                      <p>
                        (1) If You are a Tasker, You must have the right to
                        provide Services under a Task Contract and to work in
                        the Republic of Ireland and You must not be established
                        for VAT purposes outside the Republic of Ireland. You
                        must comply with tax and regulatory obligations in
                        relation to any payment (including the Tasker Funds)
                        received under a Task Contract. You must not sell goods
                        as a separate supply through the Cititasker Platform. If
                        there is an incidental supply of goods as part of a
                        supply of Services, then paragraph (2) will apply.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        (2) If the supply of any goods is part of a single
                        supply of services for VAT purposes (and is not a
                        separate supply), then the consideration for such goods
                        will be part of the Agreed Price. If You are a Tasker
                        and You supply any goods in conjunction with Your
                        Services and such goods would constitute a separate
                        supply for VAT purposes, then:

                      <ul>

                            between You and the Poster; and

                          <p>
                            (ii) the Agreed Price shall not constitute
                            consideration for such goods and be dealt with in
                            accordance with paragraph (1) above.
                          </p>
