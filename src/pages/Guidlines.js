                                                to the task is responsible for the actions of any
                                                Taskers they arrange to assist them in providing the
                                                services agreed with the Poster. If the Tasker assigned

                                                agreed with the Poster, the Tasker must gain the
                                                Poster’s consent. The Tasker assigned to the task must
                                                also ensure that all Taskers assisting them have an
                                                CitiTasket user account.

                                                other Taskers to assist with the task.
